# Python Projects

Welcome to my **Python Projects** repository! This collection contains a variety of Python projects, categorized into two sections: **Self Projects** and **Session Assignments**. Each project demonstrates different Python concepts and skills, from the basics to advanced programming techniques. 

## Project Categories

### Self Projects
These projects cover core Python concepts and are designed to help you build a foundational understanding of Python. Each project focuses on a specific Python concept.

#### 1. **Intro to Python**
   - A basic introduction to Python, focusing on the setup, syntax, and fundamental concepts.

#### 2. **Expressions**
   - Demonstrates the use of expressions and operators in Python, including arithmetic, logical, and comparison operators.

#### 3. **List**
   - Focuses on Python's list data structure, showcasing how to create, manipulate, and iterate through lists.

#### 4. **If Statements**
   - Explores decision-making in Python using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements for conditional execution.

#### 5. **Dictionaries**
   - Demonstrates the use of Python dictionaries, showing how to create, access, update, and delete key-value pairs.

#### 6. **Loops & Control Flow**
   - Introduces loops (`for`, `while`) and control flow structures to manage repetitive tasks and decision-making.

#### 7. **Functions**
   - A collection of Python functions to understand how to define and call functions, including passing arguments and returning values.

#### 8. **Information Flow**
   - Demonstrates how information flows through Python programs, including input and output handling.

## Session Assignments
These projects are part of the **PIAIC course** and use advanced Python concepts. The focus here is on creating games and interactive programs that make use of Python's more advanced features.

#### 1. **Joke Bot**
   - A fun project where a bot tells jokes based on user input, demonstrating the use of conditionals, random choices, and string manipulation.

#### 2. **High-Low Game**
   - A simple number guessing game where the program selects a number, and the player has to guess whether the next number will be higher or lower, using loops, conditionals, and random number generation.

#### 3. **Mars Weight Calculator**
   - A program to calculate a person's weight on Mars, demonstrating the use of user input, mathematical operations, and basic functions.

#### 4. **List and Dict Operations**
   - A project focused on the advanced use of lists and dictionaries, combining both to store and manipulate data efficiently.

## How to Run the Projects

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shirazkk/python-projects.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to a Specific Project**:
   For example:
   ```bash
   cd intro-to-python
   ```

3. **Run the Python Script**:
   Ensure Python is installed on your system, then run the project file:
   ```bash
   python project_name.py
   ```
