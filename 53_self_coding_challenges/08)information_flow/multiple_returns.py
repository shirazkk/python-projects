Problem Statement
There are times where you are working with lots of different data within a function that you want to return. While generally, we want to keep functions to have a precise purpose, sometimes that purpose just deals with multiple bits of data.

To practice this, imagine we are working on a program where the user needs to enters data to sign up for a website. Fill out the get_user_data() function which:

Asks the user for their first name and stores it in a variable

Asks the user for their last name and stores it in a variable

Asks the user for their email address and stores it in a variable

Returns all three of these pieces of data in the order it was asked

You can return multiple pieces of data by separating each piece with a comma in the return line.

def get_user_data():
    first_name = input("What is your first name?: ")
    last_name = input("What is your last name?: ")
    email = input("What is your email address?: ")
    
    return first_name, last_name, email  

def main():
    user_data = get_user_data()  # Get the user's data
    print(f"Received the following user data: {user_data}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
