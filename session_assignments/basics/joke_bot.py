Problem Statement
Write a simple joke bot. The bot starts by asking the user what they want. However, your program will only respond to one response: Joke.

If the user enters Joke then we will print out a single joke. Each time the joke is always the same:

Here is a joke for you! Panaversity GPT - Sophia is heading out to the grocery store. A programmer tells her: get a liter of milk, and if they have eggs, get 12. Sophia returns with 13 liters of milk. The programmer asks why and Sophia replies: 'because they had eggs'

If the user enters anything else we print out:

Sorry I only tell jokes

    "Why don't Pakistani programmers play hide and seek? Because good luck hiding from console.log! üòú",
    "Why did the Python developer break up with JavaScript? Because JavaScript had too many 'issues'!",
    "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because the light attracts too many bugs! üêû",
